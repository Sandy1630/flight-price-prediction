## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting flight ticket prices based on features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, and more. The model is trained on historical flight data to make predictions on new flight ticket prices.

## Features

- Python based solution using popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
- Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- Machine learning model selection (XGBoost) and evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/flight-ticket-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the `flight_ticket_prediction.ipynb` notebook or run the scripts to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data
